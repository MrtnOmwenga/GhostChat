# GhostChat

Ghost Chat is a secure and private chat web application I created using React, Express, Socket.io, and MongoDB. Unlike many chat applications, Ghost Chat prioritizes user privacy. It allows users to engage in one-on-one conversations and join chat rooms without storing or saving user messages. This approach ensures that user data remains confidential and is not stored on the server, making it an ideal platform for private communications.
